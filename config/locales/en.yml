    I'm working hard on the website. I'm experimenting with new technologies, writing and testing rules,
    and doing other things that help me keep the voices under control, at least most of the time.
    But I'm making progress, taking small or big steps every day. The key is to keep moving forward.
    Take care and be well. And <strong>never stop fighting</strong>.
